Notes from my cybersecurity learning journey (CIA Triad, Air Gapping, etc.)
# 🌐 Cybersecurity Learning Notes - Day 1

## 🧠 Topics I Learned Today

### 🔐 CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

The **CIA Triad** is a foundational concept in cybersecurity. It stands for:

#### 1. Confidentiality
- Ensures that data is only accessible to authorized users, processes, or systems.
- Helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
- **Techniques to achieve confidentiality**:
  - Data encryption
  - Passwords
  - Security tokens

#### 2. Integrity
- Ensures that data is **accurate, consistent, and trustworthy**.
- Prevents unauthorized changes, deletions, or manipulation of data.
- **Techniques to maintain integrity**:
  - Checksums
  - Hashing
  - Data access controls
  - Cryptographic checksums

#### 3. Availability
- Ensures data is accessible **to authorized users whenever needed**.
- Helps reduce downtime and data loss.
- **Methods to ensure availability**:
  - Backups
  - Firewalls
  - Proxy servers

### 🧊 Air Gapping

- Air gapping means **physically isolating a computer or network from the internet**.
- It helps protect highly sensitive systems (like government or military infrastructure) from cyber threats.
- This is useful because:
  - **Hackers can exploit electromagnetic or electronic signals** from a system to gather information or inject malicious code.
  - Air gapped systems are **less vulnerable** to remote cyberattacks.

### 🎭 Social Engineering (Basics)

- A technique where attackers **manipulate people** into giving away confidential information.
- Common examples:
  - Phishing emails
  - Impersonation (pretending to be IT staff)
  - Urgent fake requests (e.g. “Your account will be locked!”)

## 🔗 Why This Matters

Understanding these core principles is the **foundation** of every secure system. Whether you’re working with banks, startups, or national infrastructure, you’ll use these principles to prevent, detect, and respond to threats.
